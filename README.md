# Iris Classification with Machine Learning

This project applies and compares five supervised classification algorithms on the classic Iris dataset using scikit-learn:

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest

### Features Included

- Train-test split and cross-validation
- Confusion matrices and classification reports
- PCA for decision boundary visualization
- Feature importance analysis for tree-based models
- Final summary comparing model performance

### Best Model

Logistic Regression achieved the highest accuracy (~96.67%), though all models performed well due to the dataset's clean separability.

### Educational Goals

This notebook is designed to demonstrate the end-to-end ML workflow, including model evaluation, interpretability, and visualization.
